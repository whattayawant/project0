# project0
Through this project, I'd like to know how computer OS's work, and use C and C# to further develop my programming skills and develope new interesting functions.
I have always been interested in Github, but to be able to use this in action was really interesting. That being said, I am still confused as to the point of Vagrant (I assume that in conjunction with VirtualBox, it will enable you to edit codes on a virtual OS setting). Interested to learn what's next!

Note to self: cd /../../vagrant/,  git clone <your repo here>
